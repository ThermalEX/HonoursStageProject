## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system for automated target detection and tracking using computer vision and deep learning. The system leverages recorded video data from first-person shooter (FPS) military simulation games, specifically *Counter-Strike (CS)*, to train and evaluate detection and tracking algorithms.  

The main goal is to explore methods that could be applied in robotics, autonomous surveillance, and defense simulations, ensuring accurate detection and tracking in dynamic environments.
